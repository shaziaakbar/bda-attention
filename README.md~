# bda-attention

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
### Description: 

The Breadth-Depth Attention (BDA) framework is a weakly supervised learning technique designed to 
explore and extract relevant information for a particular task from large images. BDA employs
a unique sampling schema to iteratively capture global information and then densely sample in
specific regions of interest in an image.
This method was designed to analyse whole slide images of breast tissue and the code reflects
an experimental design for identifying cancer recurrence from large microscopic images. 


Note: this is ongoing work

#### Implementation

This specific dataset requires the openslide API in order to read ROIs from large whole slide images
