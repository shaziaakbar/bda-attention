# bda-attention

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
### Overview: 

The Breadth-Depth Attention (BDA) framework is a weakly supervised learning technique designed to 
explore and extract relevant information for a particular task from large images. BDA employs
a unique sampling schema to iteratively capture global information and then densely sample in
specific regions of interest in an image.
This method was designed to analyse whole slide images of breast tissue and the code reflects
an experimental design for identifying cancer recurrence from large microscopic images.

* Python (tested on version 3.5)
* openslide 
* Tensorflow
* Keras

### Background

To explore a large image space we adopt the concept of *attention* which has been widely applied in machine translation, natural language processing and explainability research. Historically, attention-based mechanisms are a method of weighting a context vector such that global information is captured from a large series of information, for example a document or paragraph of text. Here, we use attention to analyse large, detailed images in a weakly-supervised learning framework, whereby the only manual input is provided at the image-level. In order to discover relevant regions of interest, we sparsely sample a large image space for global information and pay particular attention to specific ROIs by densely sampling. We call our framework Breadth-Depth Attention (BDA).

Note: this is ongoing work

#### Implementation

This specific dataset requires the openslide API in order to read ROIs from large whole slide images.
